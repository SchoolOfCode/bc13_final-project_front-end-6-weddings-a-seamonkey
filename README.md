FoodMap is designed to help you work out whether the food you're buying fits with your dietary requirements.

You simply scan or enter the name of the product you're considering buying, and FoodMap will return a happy or sad face to let you know if you can eat it or not - simple!

## Authors

FoodMap was developed by a team of Bootcampers from [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.com/) as a 4-week project.
