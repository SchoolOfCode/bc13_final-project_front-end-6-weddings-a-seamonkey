        <h1>Welcome to FoodMap</h1>

        <h2>Do you find it difficult to shop for your dietary requirements?</h2>

        <p>Over 15 million people in the UK live with a chronic health condition. Some of these conditions, such as Endometriosis and IBS, can be helped by adhering to a specific diet.</p>
        
        <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
        
        <p>Packaging in supermarkets can be hard to interpret and there are so many variables to consider, that shopping for even basic foodstuffs can feel overwhelming.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        
        <p>Here is an example of the ingredients for a product with the <strong>allergens</strong> higlighted in bold:</p>

        <img src={ingredients} alt="ingredients" className="ingredients"></img>

        <p>But what if you have been advised to follow a low FODMAP diet?</p>
        
        <p>You will be asked to avoid ingredients that are high in FODMAPs. This includes not only higlighted allergens such as <strong>wheat,</strong> <strong>milk</strong> and <strong>celery</strong>, but also ingredients that are not highlighted in bold.</p>
        
        <p>Foods which are high in FODMAPs are underlined in red:</p>

        <img src={ingredientsRed} alt="ingredients with red underline" className="ingredients-red"></img>

        <p>As you can see, it's hard to pick out the ingredients you're trying to avoid.</p>

        <h2>That's where FoodMap helps!</h2>
        
        <p>FoodMap is designed to help you work out whether the food you're buying fits with your dietary requirements.</p>
